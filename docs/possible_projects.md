### <a name="monolingual-corpus"></a> Monolingual corpus
- For many NLP related tasks a large [monolingual corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus) is a necessity.
- As the name suggest a monolingual corpus (MC) stores text of only one language. In this case it will be of Odia.
- The MC mainly consists of full sentences.
#### Odia Wikipedia as an MC provider
- The major provider of MC data can be found in Odia Wikipedia.
- The source code to crawl and extract Wikipedia data can be found [here](https://github.com/goru001/nlp-for-odia/tree/master/datasets-preparation)
- You can directly get the dump from the Wikimedia site itself, you can get data dump of both Wikisource (Odia books) and Wikipedia (Odia articles) from [this site](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html). Need to cleanup a bit as well.
#### How-to do?
This is a data collection project. 
1. Extract the content from various websites with CC license by writing [web crawlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler) or taking wikipedia dump
2. Clear the corpus.
3. Prepare an Odia language sentences corpus.

### <a name="lang-detector"></a> Language detector
Given a text string, detect its language.
It should identify if Odia language text are given.
#### Existing Algorithms
1. [Google language detector](https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2)
2. 
### <a name="pos-tag"></a> Part of speech tagging
### <a name="stemming"></a> Stemming
### <a name="lemmatization"></a> Lemmatization
